                      SINGERS CLOSE FIRST SEASON
                      The Dillard University Chorus reluctantly takes its last bow as the curtain of its 1935- 36 season is slowly closing. The thousands of people before whom the group has ap- peared have experessed their appreciation by enthusiastic applause. Requests continue to come from all over the country. The chorus is pleased, but it regrets that it must end the year here.
                      This initial year has been a busy one and enjoyable. The formal concerts presented locally total seven. Minor appearances were innumerable. The climax came when the Chorus travelled to Columbus, Ohio, to ap- pear before the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Northward "Heritage" was presented in Meridian, Mis- A sissippi, and in Birmingham, Alabama. formal concert was rendered in Louisville, Kentucky.
                      The next stop was the campus of Wilber- force University, the home of the singers while in Ohio. By 8:00 o'clock on the night of May 13th the Columbus Auditorium, seating 5500, was filled to capacity, with extra seats in the aisles. Before this great audience the Dillard University Chorus un- der the direction of Professor Frederick Hall rendered "Heritage". Long applause
                      which interrupted several scenes indicated that the audience thoroughly enjoyed it, and the comments afterwards were gratifying indeed.
                      As an expression of thanks for a kind and hosiptable reception while on Wilber- force's campus, the Chorus sang several se- lections before the student body and faculty during chapel services on May 15. On Sun- day, May 17th, "Heritage" was presented at Tennessee State College. The sixth con- cert was presented at the Memorial Audi- torium, Chattanooga, Tennessee, on the eve- ning of the 18th. The final rendition of "Heritage" was given on May 19th at Ala- bama State Teachers' College, Montgomery, Alabama.
                      Before making its last appearance for this season on the commencement program, the Music Club sponsored its first annual ban- quet at which felt lyres were given to the graduating members of the organization. Again the curtain will open-but this time it will be the season of 1936-37.

                    WITH the opening of Dillard University in September came Frederick Hall, fresh from a two year period of study in Europe
                    and a four months' stay in West Africa. Before going abroad, Mr. Hall had won an enviable reputation as a conductor, 
                    teacher, and composer. While abroad he added to his equipment in abundant measure. Residence work at the Royal College of 
                    Music and London University, research in school, church, and community music in England and Wales, attendance at the National
                    Eisteddfod in Wales, the Salzburg Festival, and the Oberammergau Passion Play mark some of the high lights of his experience.
                    Soon after Dillard opened,Mr. Hall expressed that the vocal talent among the students was above the average. His unusual 
                    ability to develop a group in a short while, supported by the responsiveness of the students have given to Dillard University
                    a very fine choir. <br />
                    On several occasions, this choir has appeared before overflow audiences in New Orleans and ovations received have been great. <br /><br />
                    PRESS NOTICES AND COMMENTS:<br />
                    'A group that in a short while will rank with any choral organization in the country.' New Orleans Times-Picayune. <br />

                    'Wonderful tonal effects, unusual balance and discipline. Some of the finest singing New Orleans has ever heard.' New Orleans Tribune. <br />

                    'A very fine choir, showing excellent training. The voices blend beautifully, and they sing their own songs with sympathetic
                     feeling, and understanding, and they do the classics with definite intelligence.' New Orleans Item. <br />

                    'I have heard few choruses which seemed so perfectly drilled refering to orderliness, and discipline, as well as to the 
                    production of real music.' W. F. Amorine. 'The music rendered by your group for the Womens' Auxiliary of the National 
                    Surgical Congress was superb and was the highlight of our whole program.' Mrs. Inez B. Thomas. <br />

                    'Many who were present at your program given for the Association of American Law Schools have expressed to me that they have
                    never heard better singing anywhere.' Rufus C. Harris. 'The beautiful singing Tuesday night reflected honor upon the 
                    institution and upon the director. The voices were fine and well trained, and the demeanor of the students excellent.' Mrs. A. B. Dinwiddie.<br /><br />
                    
                    The Dillard University Choir has been chosen by the Board of Education of the Methodist Church to appear at General Conference
                    in Columbus, Ohio, in May. The presentation by this group is to be one of the major programs of the Conference. This group 
                    will be available for engagements en route to Columbus. Program rendered will be of two kinds: (1) a group of choral, quartet,
                    solo and glee club numbers, including Classics, Spirituals, and Folk Songs; (2) presentation of the Folk Pageant, 'Heritage.'<br /><br />
                    
                    HERITAGE:<br /> A musical spectacle based upon the Negro Spiritual from its African origin, reciting in drama, song and 
                    pantomine the high lights in the history of the Negro. The Pageant is written by Mr. Hall, the Spirituals are especially 
                    arranged by him and there are compositions written in the Negro idiom. There are seven scenes and every word and every tune 
                    is authentic, resulting from years of research by the author-composer.'Heritage' has been presented twice, once in Atlanta,
                    Georgia, and once in Jackson, Miss. The program managers of the General Conference have chosen it because of its artistic and
                    historical value.<br /><br />

                    COMMENTS:<br /> 'More thrilling than a movie.' Atlanta World. 'Music and drama artistically combined and produced with excellence and sympathetic understanding.' Atlanta Constitution.'An opera of which the race should be proud and to which
                    crowds will come whenever it is presented.' Wayne Sewell, Atlanta Georgian. 'A culmination of all the pathos, artistry and gaiety in the iife of the Negro, in which life music has held so prominent a part.' Jackson Daily News. 'Beautiful singing, artistic pantomine, excellent stage setting and lighting make 'Heritage' one of the finest folk spectacles on the stage today."-Jackson Daily News."
