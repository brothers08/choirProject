                <h5>
                  Dillard University is the product of a merger made manifest in 1930. Through the legacy of its
                  predecessors Straight University - 1869 (Later Straight College 1915) and New Orleans University -1872,
                  Dillard University venerates centuries of African American fortitude in the realm of musicianship,
                  musical performance, and professionalism. Straight College and New Orleans University fostered vibrant
                  and successful music programs. As pioneering institutions of higher education amongst African
                  Americans, both Straight and New Orleans University cultivated music spaces through academia, but also
                  exposure to all that encompassed Black music and theory. These institutions prioritized the works of
                  African American composers of the period. A significant gesture in the enlightenment of fertile African
                  American minds eager to hone their craft and mold the outcomes of their people. Both institutions sought
                  to intentionally use music as a means of liberation, moreover, the clarion call signifying New Orleans
                  would be hub of Black music of all genres, especially, via Dillard University.

                  May it be conveyed that the Dillard University Concert Choir has been an intricate aspect of the
                  university since its opening in 1935. The universityâ€™s appreciation and dedication to the arts were not
                  coincidental, but rather the culmination of determined visionaries who possessed an unwavering foresight
                  of the grand nature of its possibilities. Thus, the Dillard University Concert Choir is a tangible reflection
                  of such foresight. Furthermore, its continued success is a momentous homage to its forebears.
