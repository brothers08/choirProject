                                    The Dillard University Choir held its annual Christmas concert on Dec. 3 at 7:30 p.m. in Lawless Memorial Chapel.
                                    The concert, 'A Child Is Born,' was free and open to the public. It featured traditional Christmas carols, a taste of jazz, a flavor of gospel and other forms of music.
                                    S. Carver Davenport, univer- sity choir director, said that he tried to give something the entire audience would enjoy.
                                    The concert featured 100 Dillard University students and a 24-piece orchestra from the New Orleans Chamber Ensemble.
                                    Gail Bowman, university chaplain, narrated the concert and Anthony Williams, univer- sity organist, accompanied the choir along with New Orleans musician Moses G. Hogan on the piano.
                                    The processional and reces- sional of the concert included the choir's famous performance of 'Fanfare for Christmas,' where it circled the audience with candlelight.
                                    Other performances include excerpts from Handel's Messiah including the world famous 'Hallelujah Chorus.' Traditional
                                    pieces such as 'Joy to the World' were also performed along with gospel music such as 'Total Praise.'
                                    The concert featured guest artists including Cynthia A. Wilson, minister of music at Ben Hill United Methodist Church in Atlanta, Ga. Wilson is a mezzo- soprano who performed a solo arrangement of 'Silent Night' and a soulful 'Sweet Little Jesus Boy.'
                                    Other guests include Wanda Rouzan, known as the 'Sweet- heart of New Orleans Music,' who brought a jazz element to the concert and Valerie Jones- Francis, professor of music. Francis sung 'O Holy Night' and 'What Child Is This' with the orchestra.
                                    Davenport said this concert was a quality music performance. 'The concert had an outstanding turn out and I expect the same outcome again in the future,' Davenport said.
                                    The choir will now begin preparing for its spring tour during the Mardi Gras holiday and spring break to cities such as Chicago, Ill., Washington D.C., and New York, N.Y.. The choir will also participate in the Afro- American Music Festival in St. Louis, Mo., at the end of March."

                                    After twelve performances spanning from Brooklyn, New York to Houston, Texas, the Dillard University Concert Choir's Tour Sea- son has almost come to a close.
                                    The 1999-2000 Tour Season which began on March 2 and ends on April 16 is yet an- other way that Dillard University is spread- ing its name across the country. This was not a trip of relaxation, but of hard work and discipline on the part of all the choir members involved. The choir's touring is a way for Dillard University to get exposure in other parts of the country other than the Southern states. The season kicked off in Birmingham, Alabama, where the choir sang at the beauti- ful Cathedral of St. Paul.
                                    Through soulful spirituals and classical medleys, Mr. Davenport was able to express that music is universal and was able to touch the hearts of people from any religion and race. Following the concert, the choir went back on the road and headed for Atlanta, Georgia, where they did a full concert for the Reverend Cynthia A. Wilson, a former guest singer for the Dillard University Christmas Concert.
                                    The choir amazed the audience, which was filled with family members, local residents, and other schools such as Morehouse Col- lege, with their renditions of the Moses G. Hogan spirituals. After the concert, the choir
                                    members loaded the bus and headed for the hotel and only slept a few hours before they returned to the road to sing at the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York, and 'The Early Morning Show' with Brian Gumbel. The reporter and his staff were left smiling ear to ear and asking for more selections after the choir's flawless perfor-
                                    mance.
                                    Mr. Davenport then loaded the students back on the bus and encouraged them to re- sume their studies during the long ride to Washington, D. C., where they would have two full concerts back to back.
                                    During the trip, the students studied, completed assignments via e-mails, and kept up with all of their missed work while singing concert after concert. The long hours on the bus, horrific weather, and missed assignments were worth the effort-to the choir, it was all about the music. The second part of the tour was more condensed than the first, and con- centrated entirely on Houston, Texas.
                                    The choir left Friday night directly after classes and upon arrival in Texas that night, began preparations for the upcoming con- certs. In two days, the choir had four full concerts, three of which were on Sunday af- ternoon back to back. Following the con- certs, the students headed back to New Orleans to resume work as usual on Monday morning."

                                    Nu Vizion gospel choir began its ministry on Dillard's campus last spring.
                                    Joshua Guillory, a sophomore from Houston, Texas, said he started the group because there can never be enough music to praise the Lord.
                                    Nu Vizion is composed of about 70 Dillard students who have a desire to give God praise by singing.
                                    'Regardless of our constant trials and tribulations, we are a
                                    group of people who realize that God is our constant helper,' he said.
                                    Guillory said the name Nu Vizion was chosen because Jesus' death and resurrection made the people brand new.
                                    'In order to be successful in Christ we must have a vision, because without a vision, the people perish,' Guillory said.
                                    The choir's colors are purple, symbolizing royal priesthood, and black, symbolizing the power in Jesus Christ.
                                    The choir's first performance was Nov. 12 on Kabocoff Plaza
                                    for the junior class church service. Since then, the choir has been invited to perform at
                                    various local churches and is also preparing to give a concert in the spring of 2001.
                                    Guillory said that all Dillard students are welcome to join the choir.
                                    Rehearsals are once a week on alternating days in the evening. Rehearsal time and locations are posted in Kearny Hall on purple fliers. 
                                    Guillory said that practice includes Bible readings and prayers along with the musical tribute."

                                    Fusing the talents of the Dillard University Choir, the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra and WDSU News Channel 6 anchor Norman Robinson, Irvin Mayfield premiered his new musical composition, 'Strange Fruit.' The prolific concert was held on October 17 and 19 at the Alfred. K. Lawless Chapel.
                                    Irvin Mayfield is the founder and director of the Institute of Jazz Culture at Dillard University and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. Mayfield, an accomplished artist, blended jazz with spirituals, blues, and Caribbean and Latin influences to create magnificence. 'Strange Fruit,' a composition of orches- tra and choir, was written in nine movements and three triads.

                                    More importantly, 'Strange Fruit' was an embodiment of the 'healing process and an issue that is hard to discuss: guilt,' said Mayfield.

                                    Mayfield stressed the rele- vance of the composition to today's society. 'Lynching still occurred in modern day America,' he said.

                                    The orchestra delivered a sen- sual serenade representative of the love shared and the consum- mation between the young lovers. After learning of the affair, Charles', 24- year -old wealthy beau beat Mary Anne. LeRoi was blamed for the beat- ing and fated to be lynched. After Mary Anne appealed to Charles' sense of integrity, he tried to stop the lynching but failed.
                                    'A man was extinguished because people felt he was expendable because of his race not circumstance. LeRoi, thus, became a sacrificial lamb,' Mayfield said. 'His people were not worthy enough to have the choice to live their lives how they wanted.'
                                    The third triad was the death of LeRoi and the discovery of Mary Anne's pregnancy. In an inspiring finale, the choir harmo-
                                    niously delivered the sad but niously delivered the sad but soothing spiritual, 'Oh Lord, the day is done.'
                                    'Strange Fruit' closed with the birth of Mary Anne's child.
                                    'Blues is to jazz what blood is to the body,' said Mayfield. 'Blues helps us deal with our his- tory, jazz helps us move for- ward.'
                                    After the musical, another audience member echoed the same thoughts. 'The piece was beautiful. We are finding a way to heal,' said Willie Birch.
                                    'Jazz is the manifestation of democracy in music,' said Mayfield. It was the 'only palette to allow people to be indi- viduals and yet demands that they work together to resolve whatever conflicts exist.'
                                    Mayfield said that he hoped Dillard students and African- Americans would be able to iden-
                                    tify with their culture and understand how to define it.
                                    Dillard President Dr. Michael Lomax described the piece as beyond enjoyment' and he hopes that the Dillard community learn to understand that 'great art is created by real people' who can find 'inspiration from our history.'
                                    Mayfield's talents were extolled by many, including Dr. Randy Peters, associate dean of humanities. 'This a signature piece. He has arrived,' said Peters.
                                    Parts of the musical will be featured in an upcoming HBO documentary on lynching and the show was also reviewed by The New York Times. The musical was a remarkably presented display of emotion- grasping the pain and the history of lynching. And as quoted from the begin- ning of the musical, 'like art through the ages, it presents beauty and transcendence.'"
