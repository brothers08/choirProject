                            While waiting for Rev. Jackson to arrive, Dillard's gospel choir, The Voices of Liberation, performed for a packed

                                    Students, Dr. Mack Spears and Dr. Barry Ivker of the University's Lyceum Series Com mittee. This committee
                                    arranges to have guest speakers brought to the University for the benefit of both students and faculty.
                                    No formal announcements were made concerning Rev. Jackson, but students and teachers passed the word.
                                    At about 10:30 p.m. people began to pour into Lawless Memorial Chapel and within half an hour the pews
                                    were full and the walls were cluttered. At 12:00 p.m. Dean Spears announced to the waiting crowd that 
                                    Rev. Jackson would be late and asked that some 'in house' talent perform. The Voices of Liberation,
                                    Dillard's gospel choir, sung 'It Won't Be Long', accompanied by Andre Richards and Valda Slack. This was
                                    followed by an intermis- sion during which Richards played 'Can't Get Enough'. Then Dwight Franklin 
                                    accompanied The Voices of Liberation as they sang 'Save Me Lord.' Hand-slapping, foot-patting emotion 
                                    swept the chapel as Cheryl Feltus's voice resounded and Franklin. plunked at the gospel hymn 'I Found 
                                    Jesus'. A standing ovation was wrenched from the audience as she sustained a high-pitched note. An 
                                    invitation was extended to all gospel singers to come forward and participate. The call was answered by 
                                    Valda Slack, Alfreda Thomas, and Francis Minor as a trio singing 'My Choice'. The entertainment continued
                                    with a solo, 'Walk Around Heaven All Day,'' by Roslyn Scott.
                                    Finally, the renowned Rev. Jesse Jackson entered the chapel to an enthusiastic standing audience escorted
                                    by Dr. Spears and followed by Pastor A. L. Davis of the ew Zion Baptist Church where the Southern 
                                    Christian Leadership Conference was founded, Robert Tucker, executive assistant to Mayor Landrieu, and 
                                    Dr. Barry Ivker, Professor of English at Dillard University. First, Dr. Ivker commended Dr. Spears for 
                                    successfully ar- ranging Rev. Jackson's appear- ance at the university. Then Dr. Spears introduced Rev. 
                                    Jackson as the well-known organizer of Ope- ration Breadbasket and PUSH. Rev. Jackson took the microphone
                                    thanking the administrators, stud- ents, and others who had contri- buted to his presence at Dillard. He
                                    apologized for his tardiness and stated that he was in New Orleans to receive an award from the Public 
                                    Health Service. He continued with an explanation of the 'battle cry' - I AM SOMEBODY; then the audience 
                                    enthusiastically joined him in repeating the words.
                                    Rev. Jackson summed his entire speech in his opening
                                    lines: 'The greatest challenge to Black people today is to accept the responsibility of leading the whole
                                    nation....one must consider himself capable....We all have the underlying assumption that someone else 
                                    will else will do better than we....But we must not only protest against that which is inferior but 
                                    assume that we are superior! He further stated that 'excellence is revolutionary'. Rev. Jackson gave as 
                                    examples scientific facts and figures emphasizing the point that 'somebody needs to know these things'. 
                                    Then he introduced his program of five 'E's' as listed below: 1. We must be ethnic. There is no need to 
                                    apologize for Blackness. 2. We must be ethical. What does it matter if we have all the paraphernalia of 
                                    Blackness and we are dishonest? 3. We have to be excellent. Excellence is revolutionary. What made Black
                                    colleges great was that Black students decided that getting beyond high school was the best way to survive.
                                    4. Economics. We are afraid to deal with it. 5. The Eternal. We as a group of people need not forget our
                                    religion for it has brought us thus far...They (our forefathers) believed in you before they believed in
                                    themselves, for you represented the coming of heaven. The speech was followed by a question and answer 
                                    period during which Rev. Jackson said that there is no one thing we can do for freedom but that a strong
                                    and developed mind is the key to freedom. As Rev. Jackson was leaving the chapel, students crowded around
                                    to shake his hand, to take photographs, and to speak to the one who said, 'We can rise above any circumstance.' By Brenda Osbey"

                                    The Dillard University Concert Choir, under the direction of S. Carver Davenport, performed in Shreveport,
                                    Louisiana on September 27. The program was sponsored to promote and strengthen the Alumni Association in
                                    Shreveport. Mr. M. Neustater and Mrs. V. Oneil coordinated the audio- visual materials. Due to a minimum
                                    number of participants, the program did not begin as scheduled. Nevertheless, it began with introductions
                                    by Mrs. O'Neil and Mr. Neustater. Dr. Parikh and Mrs. Barbara Murray served as coordinators for the music
                                    and a slide show. After viewing an excellent presentation of Dillard and its campus, the Dillard University
                                    Concert Choir took to the stage voicing such compositions as 'Don't You Weep No More','Rockin Jerusalem'
                                    and 'Fair Dillard.' Snacks and cocktails were served afterward. With the combined effort and support of 
                                    the Dillard Family, the University Concert Choir may be able to undertake similar engagements in their 
                                    quest to spread the harmonious beauty of the song.

                                    The New Orleans Chapter of the Dillard University Alumni Association payed tribute to Dr. Frederick 
                                    Douglass Hall, professor of music, emeritus, composer and historian-in-residence, with a concert in his

                                    Concert Choir. Dr. hall received a B.A. from Morehouse College; Mus. B., Chicago Musical College; M.A. 
                                    and Professional Diploma, and Ed.D., Teachers College, Columbia University, and LL.D, Rust College. He

                                    London School of Oriental Studies. He was a member of the original Dillard Faculty when the university 
                                    opened for instruction in September, 1935, and was responsible for the organization and training of the 
                                    Delta Rhythm Boys, the group who achieved fame nationally and abroad during the late thirties and forties.
                                    Dr. Hall composed and arranged many of the numbers that made the group famous. During the program, the

                                    'Yonder Come Day'. Under the direction of Samuel Carver Davenport, assistant professor of music, the

                                    the song. Some of the songs that were done by the Concert Choir included: 'Don't You Weep No More Mary', 
                                    'Precious Lord', 'Soon Ah Will Be Done', 'Sing and Rejoice', 'Benedictus', and a host of others. The 
                                    concert was open to the public without charge, and a reception immediately followed. The Concert Choir 
                                    extends thanks to all who made the concert possible." />
