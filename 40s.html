                    announced in January. These three volumes contain thirty-odd of the better known spirituals and folk songs and are 
                    published in the arrangements which have gained such wide atten- tion when sung by Mr. Hall's choral groups at Dillard. 
                    Many of the songs in this collection were sung by the Dillard quartet which toured South America two years ago and which 
                    has recently appeared on Broadway. 
                    Mr. Hall is well-known for his compositions and arrangements of Negro melodies and in recent years has written in the 
                    choral form. Less than a year ago he conducted the first performance of a new cantata, 'Deliverance,' in which he made 
                    use of several Negro melodies. He is a graduate of Morehouse College with the Bachelor of Arts degree, of the Chicago 
                    Musical College with the Bachelor of Music degree, and of Columbia. University with the Master of Arts degree in music. He

                    Dillard University will hold its fourth annual Arts Festival from April 14 to April 21, it was announced early this month. 
                    Plans for the exhibition of paintings by Negro artists which has been a feature of the Arts Festival each year since its 
                    inception were an- nounced in December. Simultaneously, there were announced plans for an ex- hibition of photography by 
                    Negro amateurs and professionals, the first to be sponsored by the University. Pic- tures will be accepted until April 1 and
                    the official opening of the exhibi- tion will coincide with the opening of the Arts Festival. Prizes totaling $115 will be 
                    awarded to the two best paintings and photographs entered.
                    Although final arrangements have not been completed, present plans call for a motion picture and gallery tour of the 
                    exhibitions as the opening fea- ture of the Festival. On Monday, the University Chorus, in the first festival concert, will
                    sing 'The Creation' by Haydn, and on Tuesday evening, the Players Guild will present Karel Ca- pek's three-act fantasy, 'R.
                    U. R.'' In addition to these major programs there will be held throughout the week as- sembly talks, group discussions, and 
                    programs by the music and drama community groups. The Arts Festival is sponsored each year by the University to encourage a 
                    greater participation by the general public in the fine arts, and is the result of the combined efforts of the University's 
                    departments of art, music, and drama. In addition to the participa- tion of student and community groups," />

                    The music and drama groups of Dillard University have been signally honored by invitations to participate in two important 
                    festivals this spring. The Players Guild will appear at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill on April 4, 5, and 6,
                    as a part of the folk drama festival and the twenty- first birthday celebration of the Caro- lina Playmakers, founded by 
                    Professor Frederick H. Koch, head of the folk play movement in the United States. The Players Guild will present a one act 
                    folk play written by S. Randolph Edmonds, Professor of Drama at Dillard. The Dillard chorus has accepted an invitation to 
                    sing at the National Folk Festival in Washington, D. C., on April 25. The chorus will present scenes from a folk pageant, 
                    'Heritage,' written by Frederick Hall. They will also attend some of the meetings at West Virginia State College of the 
                    Association of Music Teachers in Ne- gro Schools of which Mr. Hall is president. The chorus will fill en- gagements in

                    victimized by its expression. A group of younger players were cast in the principal roles and gave a creditable 
                    performance. Again the set and lighting were very well done. The Barretts of Wimpole Street is the next scheduled offering
                    of the Players Guild, to be followed in the late spring by the bill of one-act plays. The Dillard University Band, 
                    augmented by new members and employing new instrumentation, played for all home football games last fall. A small ensemble
                    from the Band also played the music for the Christmas production of “The Living Madonnas,” a program that saw the first 
                    appearance of a new choral ensemble, The A Capella Choir, which has developed into the University's concert choir.

                    The University Choir of fifty-eight voices rendered the traditional Christmas program, Handel’s The Messiah, employing 
                    student soloists who gave entirely commendable performances. The Choir also furnished music for the formal vesper services
                    on Sunday afternoons during the past semester. Both the A Capella Choir and the University Choir have given concerts off
                    campus during the fall and winter, the former having sung in several Louisiana cities in recent months and the latter
                    having given a program for the State meeting of the Louisiana Teachers Association.
                    The Department of Music inaugurated during the fall a series of Friday afternoon programs designed to give its majors 
                    experience in concert performances, the series having attracted and pleased a growing audience at these performances. In
                    addition, the Department formed a small string ensemble to afford Opportunity for study and performance to faculty members
                    and citizens of the community desiring employment of their interest and talents, the group meeting on Friday evenings. It
                    is hoped that from this small nucleus may grow a community orchestra capable of concert performance. The latest venture
                    of the department is a weekly Institute of Church Music sponsored in conjunction with the department of Religion. The 
                    object of the institute is to assist churches in the community to improve the quality of the music used in worship services.
                    The venture has met a growing response among ministers and directors of church choirs.
                    “Source of all nobleness and pow’r.” A stated objective of Dillard University is to assist its students to the achievement
